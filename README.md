# Incorrect Handling of Negative Numbers in Julia Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia where a function's conditional logic does not correctly handle negative numbers. The original `myfunction` incorrectly calculates the square of negative numbers due to an error in the conditional statements.

The `bug.jl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.jl` provides the corrected version. The solution addresses the issue by accurately processing negative inputs within the conditional logic to produce the intended output.
